				| I am an island boy from Puget Sound, Washington.  I started web development maintaining internal web apps for a sattelite component manufacturer
				| in my home town.  Over time, my work grew to include a number of clients around the world in industries like GIS mapping, datastructure design, serverside infrastructure,
				| and user interface design.
